## go-cryptocurrency
A simple implementation of a cryptocurrency using Go, demonstrating fundamental concepts of blockchain technology.


## GoCryptocurrency
Welcome to GoCryptocurrency! This project is a simple implementation of a cryptocurrency, built from scratch using the Go programming language. It serves as a learning exercise and a demonstration of fundamental concepts in blockchain technology and cryptocurrency.

## Key Features:

Basic implementation of a blockchain
Proof of work algorithm
Simple transaction model
Basic wallet with public key cryptography
Installation and Setup:

Ensure you have Go installed and set up on your machine.
Clone this repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/go-cryptocurrency.git
Navigate into the project directory: cd go-cryptocurrency
Run the program: go run .
How it Works:

A blockchain is a decentralized and distributed digital ledger that records transactions across multiple computers so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the alteration of all subsequent blocks. This allows the participants to verify and audit transactions instantaneously.

In this simple implementation, we have blocks containing transactions. We also have a proof of work system to secure the network and a basic wallet system to store the public and private key pair of a user.

## Disclaimer:

This project is a simplified cryptocurrency model built for educational purposes and is not suitable for real-world use in its current state. The security, efficiency, and robustness of this model are not comparable to production-ready cryptocurrencies.
